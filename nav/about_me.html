            <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/clowder" target="_blank"> clowder</a> of floofs.

                I enjoy being the Guardian to these four elements
                known as my clowder. They keep me grounded and
                they are quite the comedians.
                I am currently training them to target a button for button training.
                Three out of four will work for treats.
            </p>
            <p>My superpower is Patience. These little bundles of
                contradiction have been helping me perfect it.
            </p>
            <p>Some of my other hobbies include reading,
                learning new things, knitting, drawing,
                painting and calligraphy.
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy yoga, swimming, tai chi, and taekwondo.
            </p>
            <p>I like to travel but am a hermit and prefer
                the ocean or mountains over cities.

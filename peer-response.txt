The peer suggestions are as follows
change the font size on your quote, 
thats on top of your website.

centered the return to top link
at the bottom of the main page

the "catios" navigation menu link, 
the header expands slightly on the 
bottom instead of staying uniform 
like the other links


I changed the size, font and color 
of the the block quote located in the header.

Centered the return to top link on the Home page
and Catio pages.

The Catio page no longer expands and all headers
 are uniform when switching between pages.

 I added a table in The Floofs page.
 I added two different fonts from Google fonts.
 I added a favicon to my website. 
 However it doesn't seem to work in gitpages.
 I also added paw icons to the navigation menu as 
 well as in various places on nav pages.
